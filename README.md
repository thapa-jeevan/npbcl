# Bayesian Structure Adaptation for Continual Learning

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Bayesian Structure Adaptation for Continual Learning.

# Requirements

* Keras 2.2.5
* PyTorch 1.3.1
* torchvision 0.4.2
* scipy 1.3.1
* sklearn 0.21.3
* numpy 1.17.2
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* gzip, pickle, tarfile, urllib, PIL, math, copy
* A cuda enabled 12 GB GPU (GeForce GTX 1080 Ti) / Equivalent Devices / Google Colab

# Running the experiments

To run all experiments together (might take a while) use : `sh run_all.sh`
Note here tfree represents the task-agnostic setting. For running convolutional network for cifar100 you need to run the
file inside Convolutional folder in similar manner as this folder.

Individual experiments can be run using `pyhton3 experiment_name.py`

- Experiment names starts with : `npbcl_xxx.py`
- Copy and save the stored experiment models using : `echo -e "saves\ncache/destination" | python3 save.py`
- Copy and save the generative experiment images : `echo -e "Gens\ncache/destination" | python3 save.py`

# Running on Google Colaboratory

- Create a new notebook on colab and clone this repo : `! git clone https://github.com/npbcl/icml21.git`
- Change working directory to icml20 folder : `os.chdir('icml21')`
- Run all experiments : `sh run_all.sh`

# Results

If you ran all experiments using sh file. You can see all experiment results in cache folder.
After individual experiment the results are stored in saves folder and Gens folder.
